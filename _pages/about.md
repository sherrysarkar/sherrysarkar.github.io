I'm a sixth and final year mathematics PhD student in the Algorithms, Combinatorics, Optimization program at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Anupam Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/).

I've also had the pleasure of doing a lot of research outside of CMU -- last summer, I worked with the Algorithms Group at Microsoft Research, and in the fall of 2022, I was part of the Simons Theory of Computering "Data Driven Decision Properties" program.

I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2020. I am interested in all things discrete optimization. Some of my favorite problems include online bipartite matching (and its generalization to matroid intersection), and network design. I like to study problems in both a full information (offline) and parital information setting (online), and my current research direction is to understand what flexibility applications might lend to online problems to give us offline performance guarantees.

I also really enjoy mentoring and teaching. I've teaching at the undergraduate level for over eight years; I've also taught in high school math circles as well as done outreach and tutoring volunteer work for elemetary students. For mentoring, I've been particularly involved in the [Polymath Jr Research Program](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu); in 2023, I led my own research group producing surveys in theory CS.

Outside of work, I am an avid foodie, I foster cats, and I rock climb!
