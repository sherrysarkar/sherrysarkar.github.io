I'm a fourth year mathematics PhD student in the Algorithms, Combinatorics, Optimization program at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Anupam Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/). In 2020, I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am primarily interested in combinatorial optimization. Some of my favorite problems include online bipartite matching (and its generalization to matroid intersection), and network design. I've recently been thinking about combinatorial problems in an online or stochastic setting.

I also enjoy mentoring and teaching. I've been particularly involved in the [Polymath Jr Research Program](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu); in 2023, I was the lead mentor of a research group producing surveys in theory CS.

Outside of work, I am an avid foodie and I rock climb!
